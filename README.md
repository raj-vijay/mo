# Metaheuristic Optimization

In a complex world, where perfection is often non-existant, Metaheuristics provide 'acceptable' solutions in a reasonable timeframe for solving hard and complex problems in science and engineering.

The Metaheuristic Optimization Library hosts my code base for the various Metaheuristic Optimization problems and exercises in the real world that I have solved and completed as part of my work on optimization.

It has to be noted that metaheuristics do not guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions. Unlike approximation algorithms, metaheuristics do not define how close the derived solutions are from the optimal ones.


# The Repository
The repository for Metaheuristic Optimization is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to Metaheuristic Optimization problems. It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file.

It is always possible go back to previous versions of we make any mistakes.

So, feel free, be more human, to make mistakes and to learn from them.
